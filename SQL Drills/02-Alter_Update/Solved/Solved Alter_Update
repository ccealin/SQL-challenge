###Part 1
Alter: Allows one to edit the table structure, such as changing the number of columns/rows, data types of a column, renaming columns, renaming tables, and so forth. It is a Data Definition Language (DDL). Unlike an UPDATE statement, the ALTER statement does not change the data itself.
Update: Allows one to edit existing data in a table, not the structure, in three steps: UPDATE, SET, WHERE. It is a Data Manipulation Language (DML).
